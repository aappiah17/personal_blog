A key step in the policy or program development cycle is evaluation. Evaluation can take the form of an assessment of the processes involved in implementing a program or policy, or an assessment of the impact of the program or policy.

The Finance Minister, in his presentation, stated a few times that despite the challenges the country experienced, it has turned the corner. The minister suggested that the numbers are beginning to show that the nation has turned things around. There have been many reactions to this statement by the minister. As a citizen and not a spectator, I thought it would be a great exercise to query the public database and establish whether the country has indeed turned the corner as suggested. The public data sources we will be using are the Bank of Ghana's [repository of economic data](https://www.bog.gov.gh/economic-data/), the Ghana Statistical Services' [quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) bulletin](https://statsghana.gov.gh/nationalaccount_macros.php?Stats=Mjc0NDcwNzcxOS4xNTY=/webstats/074s5o3p9r) and the [national budget](https://mofep.gov.gh/publications/budget-statements) as published by the Ministry of Finance.

Before we go any further, we need to first establish the *corner*. In other words, we need to understand what turning the corner means within the context of the Ghanaian economy. The minister is comparing key economic indicators at the time of the presentation to the levels in December 2022 (see screenshot below). But why December 2022? That was the month when headline inflation level was highest in decades. The Bank of Ghana's key interest rate, the monetary policy rate, was highest in at least two decades.

However, using December 2022 to establish turning the corner is not right, and that is why many disagree that we have indeed turned the corner. Truly turning the corner should mean that key economic indicators are starting to trend towards the levels they were before the COVID-19 pandemic hit us in March 2020. Remember, the government of Ghana continuously told us that the Ghanaian economy was strong and robust before the pandemic? Of course, you do. It was a key message for government.

Throughout this article, we will compare key economic indicators to the levels they were pre-pandemic and establish whether we have truly turned the corner. We will look at measures of economic growth, prices and interest rates, foreign exchange, international reserves and consumer/business confidence in the economy.

## Pre-Intervention

First, we discuss the rate of economic growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) is Ghana's official measure of economic growth. GDP is the total market value of all finished goods and services produced within Ghana's borders over a specified period (e.g., quarterly or annually). A way of establishing the rate of economic growth is comparing the real GDP (i.e., GDP adjusted to remove the effect of inflation) between periods. To determine whether we have turned the corner in terms of economic growth, we use Q4 of 2019 as the reference point. Ghana's GDP is normally published at the quarterly level and 2019 Q4 is the quarter before the pandemic hit us in 2020 Q1.

As shown in the chart below, economic growth has recovered very well above pre-pandemic levels.

### Understated baselines

But this recovery in GDP growth is not uniform across all sectors. Whereas the agriculture and services sectors have recovered well above pre-pandemic levels, the industry sector continues to struggle to achieve the growth levels it had pre-pandemic.

When we dig a bit deeper into the industrial sector, we observe that growth in the mining and quarrying sub-sector (which includes the oil and gas sector) has continuously been below the levels seen pre-pandemic and not showing any signs of recovery towards that level. Other sub-sectors such as water and waste management, electricity are growing above their pre-pandemic levels.

### Lack of recognition of historical trends

Another indicator that helps tracks economic activity is the Bank of Ghana's composite index of economic activity (CIEA). The CIEA combines several indicators like retail sales, port activity, cement sales, imports, exports, tourist arrivals, credit to the private sector, industrial consumption of electricity and job adverts into one indicator and tracks how that changes over time. The continuous growth in real CIEA, after a slump in the initial stages of the pandemic, shows that it has recovered significantly well above its pre-pandemic level. That provides further evidence that the level of economic activity in the country has recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

Looking at economic activity alone suggests that economy has recovered (or turned the corner). But we cannot just look at economic activity alone. Next, we look at prices and interest rates growth.

## Post-Intervention Outcomes

Ghana, like almost every other jurisdiction, uses the consumer price index (CPI) to measure the rate of growth in the general price level. The CPI measures changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by households. A fixed basket of goods and services is used so that any changes in the value of the basket can be attributed to price changes. The Ghana Statistical Service releases the CPI each month.

We compare the consumer price index in February 2020 (i.e., the month before COVID-19 hit us) to subsequent months to establish whether Ghana has turned the corner.

As shown in the chart below, prices of all items have significantly grown well above the levels they were pre-pandemic. The prices of food items continue to grow well above pre-pandemic levels and not showing any signs of trending towards that level.

The government of Ghana has also referenced Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a contributory factor to economic challenges and price growth. Even a comparison to pre-Russia-Ukraine price levels still shows about 90% growth in food prices as at June 2023.

### No Recognition of other factors

The Bank of Ghana implements monetary policy by influencing interest rates. It does so through the monetary policy rate (previously called the bank rate or the prime rate, depending on your age). It is often called the key interest rate because it serves as a reference cap for all other rates in the economy and it's also simply the rate at which the Bank lends to commercial banks. The average monetary policy rate in 12-month period before COVID-19 was 16%. The rate has been trending upwards since then and currently at 30%.

Another interest rate worth looking at is the inter-bank weighted average rate, which is simply the rate at which commercial banks lend to each other. The average rate pre-pandemic was 15% and it's currently at 26%.

Finally, and likely the most important interest rate to you as a reader is the commercial bank lending rate. That is the rate at which commercial banks lend money to you. Pre-pandemic commercial bank lending rate was at 24%. It is currently at 32%.

### Post intervention data that doesn't align with other govt sources

It is clear that based on prices and interest rates growth, we have not seen recovery towards pre-pandemic levels.

## Way Forward

It is no news that the US dollars (USD) is important to Ghanaians. So, exchange rate movements are very important to Ghanaians. In the 12-month period before the pandemic, 1 USD was equivalent 5.3 Ghana cedis. After a period of relative stability, the USD rose significantly against the cedi. As of July 2023, the average inter-bank rate was 1 USD to 11 Ghana cedis. Even though the cedi has been relatively stable, the exchange rate is still significantly higher than the levels seen pre-pandemic as shown in the chart below.
