    "text": "When Ghana’s Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia (DMB), was on a health walk in the Eastern Region earlier this month, he told party supporters that his government has created2.1 million jobs since 2017 and these jobs are verifiable. Last week, he doubled down on that claim and shared asnippet of an Excel spreadsheet with jobs supposedly created per year by ministries and agencies as well as the private sector, proxied by SSNIT registrations. The data showed that 2,255,928 total jobs have been created between 2017 and 2022, with 1,280,764 in the public sector and the remaining 975,164 in the private sector. The data shared made me curious and I decided to take a look at data from other publicly available labour market trackers to see how they match up. In short, the numbers shared by the VEEP simply do not add up!\nGenerally, in advanced economies, monthly labour force surveys are conducted to estimate labour market indicators like employment rate, unemployment rate, and wage growth among other things. Each month, the national statistical agencies of those jurisdictions would share the jobs data. This ensures easy comparisons over different periods of time, for instance, on monthly, quarterly or annual bases.\nThe challenge in jurisdictions like Ghana, however, is that we do not have that type of data available at that frequency. For example, Ghana conducted its first full labour force survey in 2015 and released the report in 2017. But that has since not been repeated. The Ghana Statistical Services (GSS) has tried to change that, and last year, the institution started conducting a household income and expenditure survey (AHIES). This survey has employment-related questions that help us measure the health of our labour market. The most recent report in the survey was published in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn this article, I will attempt to provide alternative evidence to show why the total number of jobs reportedly created by the current government (2,255,928) does not add up. For context, an employed person is defined by the Ghana Statistical Service as “someone 15 years and older who is engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit (either in cash or in kind) during the reference period”. This includes people in paid employment, those self-employed and those engaged in a family business for payment in cash or in kind."

    "section": "Overall job growth from publicly available sources",
    "text": "Overall job growth from publicly available sources\nWhen Ghana first conducted its labour force survey in 2015, the estimated number of employed people in Ghana was approximately 9.3 million. When the GSS last checked on the labour market in 2022, there were approximately 10.7 million employed Ghanaians. The job growth between those two time periods is about 1.4 million. Remember that this job growth covers about 7 years. And this is job growth across all sectors, regardless of the level of formality.\nWhat about retirements? Given that approximately 80% of the workforce is in informal employment, we consider the share of the inactive labour force who officially identify as pensioners as well as those who are inactive because of old age as the retired population. In the 2015 LFS, this population was 600,668 strong. The number increased to 687,274 in 2022. Even if we add the change in that number (approximately 90,000) to employment growth, we will still be below the 2.3 million number shared by the vice president. But also remember that replacing retired employees is not necessarily creating new jobs!\n\nThe data shared by the Veep based on employment records from ministries, departments and agencies, as well as private SSNIT formal, suggests that he may have been only referencing formal sector jobs created. The other thing that makes me reach this conclusion is the exclusion of jobs created through the government’s flagship Planting for Food and Jobs program. The jobs created through this program would be largely informal in the agricultural sector.\nBased on data from the most recent Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), 2021 Census and the AHIES, the percentage of the employed population in Ghana who actually work in the formal sector range between 15% and 25%. If we apply the higher end of that range to the job growth between 2015 and 2022, the estimated number of formal new jobs is about 350,000.\nThat is nowhere near the 2.3m jobs reportedly created by the current government."

    "text": "Public sector jobs\nDr Bawumia’s data shows a total of 1,280,764 public sector jobs created from 2017 to 2022. As shown in the chart below, the estimated number of public sector workers in 2015 from the labour force survey was about 690,000. The recent census indicated that about 947,000 Ghanaians work in the public sector. Between those two time periods (about 6 years), public sector jobs have grown by approximately 256k jobs. Again, that is significantly lower (5 times lower) than the number of public sector jobs supposedly created by the current government.\n\nAnother data source that provides insight into public sector job growth is the government’s own budget statements. In 2017, the estimated size of the public service was 626,781. This has increased to 804,240 in 2022. I have seen commentary by pro-government accounts on social media that the public sector staff strength shown in the budget only covers those paid through the Controller and Accountant General’s Department (CAGD).\nWhen the GSS analyzed the CAGD’s payroll data earlier in 2023, it found that there were 688,000 employees on that payroll. It also indicated that there were reports that 90% of all public sector employees are on that payroll. So, assuming we add the remaining 10% who are not on that payroll, we’ll be looking at approximately 750,000 public sector employees. That is nowhere near the nearly 1.3m public sector jobs supposedly created by the current government. Even if the values were closer, the full size of the public service workforce could not be attributed to the current government because there were people working in the public service before they took power.\nUnless of course, the wildest assumption is that all the existing public sector workers were fired and new ones were hired. But that wouldn’t even necessarily count as new jobs created, just replacements."

    "text": "Private sector jobs\nThe vice president’s data also shows that a total of 975,164 private sector formal jobs have been created over the same period under consideration. Based on the title of that row in the data Private Formal (SSNIT), one can only assume that this is the number of new private sector registrations under SSNIT. The main issue with that indicator is that not every new registration with SSNIT is necessarily a new job created. SSNIT, over the last few years, has been on campaigns to get employers to register their employees under the scheme. Using the new registrations each year as an indicator for new jobs would include employees who have been working for a long period of time but only got registered on SSNIT years later.\nBut we will use that number for now and try to show how it compares to other existing labour market data sources. The recent annual household income and expenditure survey showed that there were 972,050 private formal employees in Ghana. One would be tempted to conclude that this number is similar to what the Veep has for private-sector employment. Remember, however, that the data from AHIES is the number of people who are employed in the private sector, regardless of when they started. Many would have been employed even before the current government came to power. So again, unless someone is making a wild assumption that the current government sacked all private sector workers it came to meet and hired new ones between 2017 and 2022, the vice president’s number does not add up."

    "text": "Impact on personal income tax revenue\nThe government of Ghana has over the last few years claimed that many Ghanaians do not pay taxes. The Finance minister has said that only about 2.4m Ghanaians are bearing the burden of tax payment. Nevertheless, the government is saying it has created 2.3m new jobs from 2017 to 2022. Could it be that only the positions created by the government over those years are paying income taxes?\nIf so, then what personal income tax revenue was the government relying on before creating the jobs over those years? If that’s not the case, then is it that a significant share of the jobs created by the government is not sustainable enough to continue paying income taxes? Are some of these positions evading taxes? If so, shouldn’t the government be tracking them to make sure they pay their fair share of taxes since they have a job tracker?\nThe figure below shows personal income tax revenue as a percentage of all tax revenues, using the Ministry of Finance’s fiscal data. When the current government retained power in 2017, 16% of all tax revenues were from personal income taxes, which include pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and self-employment income taxes. The chart shows no significant growth in this percentage, with the latest data in 2022 also being 16%.\nIf indeed the current government has created new jobs that are equivalent to a quarter of the total employed population of Ghana, why are we not seeing significant changes in revenue from income taxes? That brings us back to the earlier question of whether the jobs are not sustainable enough or simply not paying enough taxes or simply do not exist.\n\nWhen we look at revenue from personal income taxes in absolute terms and adjust for inflation using 2022 constant cedis, the average annual growth in personal income taxes under the current government is approximately 9%. Again, if there have been 2.3 million jobs created, the growth in income taxes should be significantly higher than 9%."

    "section": "Looking ahead",
    "text": "Looking ahead\nThe focus of my analysis so far has been on trying to provide alternative evidence that suggests that the job creation numbers presented by the Veep do not add up. But in jurisdictions like ours, indicators like employment numbers, and the unemployment rate are not the most important for checking the pulse of our labour market. Researchers like my former econometrics professor, Prof. William Baah-Boateng, have argued that because the majority of our labour force is in the informal sector, the unemployment rate, for example, is not the best indicator to look at. By definition, whatever economic activity someone is engaged in, whether good or bad quality (based on income, working conditions, etc.) would be counted as employment. The following are some important indicators to pay attention to in addition to the standard employment numbers or unemployment rate.\n\nVulnerable employment\nOne important indicator to look at is the percentage of the employed population that is in vulnerable employment. That is, people who are self-employed without any employees or those who help in running a family economic enterprise without payment or wages. People in these types of employment situations usually lack decent work, have inadequate earnings, low productivity and have difficult working conditions according to the GSS.\nData from the 2015 labour force survey showed that as high as 68% of the employed Ghanaian population were in vulnerable employment. Fast forward to 2022 and the AHIES also found that 68% of the employed population is in vulnerable employment. Despite all the jobs supposedly created from 2017 to 2022, we have not managed to move the dial on the share of the employed population that are in vulnerable employment. That is the real outcome indicator to focus on!\n\n\nLabour underutilization (Underemployment)\nIt is known that there are some people who are employed, but working less than 40 hours a week (full-time) and willing to work more. The technical term for that is time-related underemployment.  In 2015, the LFS estimated that about 10% of the employed population was underemployed. The GLSS in 2016/17 estimated that number to be as high as 21%. This is an indicator to track continuously to see to what extent the labour market is fully utilizing the employed population.\n\n\nEarnings\nOne of the most important parts of working is making money. I don’t think many would disagree. An important metric to track regarding the health of the labour market is how much workers are earning on average and how much that is growing. For example, the average monthly earnings from the 2015 labour force was 897 cedis. Fast forward to 2022, the AHIES estimates the average monthly salary as just over 1,500 cedis. So, in that time period, average earnings have grown by about 70%. Compare that to a 143% growth in the consumer price index over the same time period and you would see that the purchasing power of workers has reduced significantly. That is another indicator to look at and create the enabling environment for change.\nHuge credits to Austine Woode and Nii Sarpei Hornsby for providing insightful feedback and proofreading an earlier version of the article."

    "text": "Ghana’s Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Attah, presented the mid-year fiscal policy review of the Government of Ghana’s 2023 budget on Monday July 31, 2023, as required by law. Mid-year fiscal policy reviews provide an opportunity for the central government to update members of the legislature, and Ghanaians on the status of the execution of the budget it had previously presented. It is also an opportunity for government to present year-end key economic indicators for the previous fiscal year.\nThe Finance Minister, in his presentation, stated a few times that despite the challenges the country experienced, it has turned the corner. The minister suggested that the numbers are beginning to show that the nation has turned things around. There have been many reactions to this statement by the minister. As a citizen and not a spectator, I thought it would be a great exercise to query the public database and establish whether the country has indeed turned the corner as suggested. The public data sources we will be using are the Bank of Ghana’s repository of economic data, the Ghana Statistical Services’ quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) bulletin and the national budget as published by the Ministry of Finance.\nBefore we go any further, we need to first establish the corner. In other words, we need to understand what turning the corner means within the context of the Ghanaian economy. The minister is comparing key economic indicators at the time of the presentation to the levels in December 2022 (see screenshot below). But why December 2022? That was the month when headline inflation level was highest in decades. The Bank of Ghana’s key interest rate, the monetary policy rate, was highest in at least two decades.\nHowever, using December 2022 to establish turning the corner is not right, and that is why many disagree that we have indeed turned the corner. Truly turning the corner should mean that key economic indicators are starting to trend towards the levels they were before the COVID-19 pandemic hit us in March 2020. Remember, the government of Ghana continuously told us that the Ghanaian economy was strong and robust before the pandemic? Of course, you do. It was a key message for government.\nThroughout this article, we will compare key economic indicators to the levels they were pre-pandemic and establish whether we have truly turned the corner. We will look at measures of economic growth, prices and interest rates, foreign exchange, international reserves and consumer/business confidence in the economy."

    "text": "Economic growth\nFirst, we discuss the rate of economic growth. Gross domestic product (GDP) is Ghana’s official measure of economic growth. GDP is the total market value of all finished goods and services produced within Ghana’s borders over a specified period (e.g., quarterly or annually). A way of establishing the rate of economic growth is comparing the real GDP (i.e., GDP adjusted to remove the effect of inflation) between periods. To determine whether we have turned the corner in terms of economic growth, we use Q4 of 2019 as the reference point. Ghana’s GDP is normally published at the quarterly level and 2019 Q4 is the quarter before the pandemic hit us in 2020 Q1.\nAs shown in the chart below, economic growth has recovered very well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBut this recovery in GDP growth is not uniform across all sectors. Whereas the agriculture and services sectors have recovered well above pre-pandemic levels, the industry sector continues to struggle to achieve the growth levels it had pre-pandemic.\n\nWhen we dig a bit deeper into the industrial sector, we observe that growth in the mining and quarrying sub-sector (which includes the oil and gas sector) has continuously been below the levels seen pre-pandemic and not showing any signs of recovery towards that level. Other sub-sectors such as water and waste management, electricity are growing above their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAnother indicator that helps tracks economic activity is the Bank of Ghana’s composite index of economic activity (CIEA). The CIEA combines several indicators like retail sales, port activity, cement sales, imports, exports, tourist arrivals, credit to the private sector, industrial consumption of electricity and job adverts into one indicator and tracks how that changes over time. The continuous growth in real CIEA, after a slump in the initial stages of the pandemic, shows that it has recovered significantly well above its pre-pandemic level. That provides further evidence that the level of economic activity in the country has recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLooking at economic activity alone suggests that economy has recovered (or turned the corner). But we cannot just look at economic activity alone. Next, we look at prices and interest rates growth."

    "text": "Inflation and interest rate growth\n\nInflation\nGhana, like almost every other jurisdiction, uses the consumer price index (CPI) to measure the rate of growth in the general price level. The CPI measures changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by households. A fixed basket of goods and services is used so that any changes in the value of the basket can be attributed to price changes. The Ghana Statistical Service releases the CPI each month.\nWe compare the consumer price index in February 2020 (i.e., the month before COVID-19 hit us) to subsequent months to establish whether Ghana has turned the corner.\nAs shown in the chart below, prices of all items have significantly grown well above the levels they were pre-pandemic. The prices of food items continue to grow well above pre-pandemic levels and not showing any signs of trending towards that level.\n\nThe government of Ghana has also referenced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a contributory factor to economic challenges and price growth. Even a comparison to pre-Russia-Ukraine price levels still shows about 90% growth in food prices as at June 2023.\n\n\n\nInterest rates\nThe Bank of Ghana implements monetary policy by influencing interest rates. It does so through the monetary policy rate (previously called the bank rate or the prime rate, depending on your age). It is often called the key interest rate because it serves as a reference cap for all other rates in the economy and it’s also simply the rate at which the Bank lends to commercial banks. The average monetary policy rate in 12-month period before COVID-19 was 16%. The rate has been trending upwards since then and currently at 30%.\nAnother interest rate worth looking at is the inter-bank weighted average rate, which is simply the rate at which commercial banks lend to each other. The average rate pre-pandemic was 15% and it’s currently at 26%.\nFinally, and likely the most important interest rate to you as a reader is the commercial bank lending rate. That is the rate at which commercial banks lend money to you. Pre-pandemic commercial bank lending rate was at 24%. It is currently at 32%.\n\nIt is clear that based on prices and interest rates growth, we have not seen recovery towards pre-pandemic levels."

So, exchange rate movements are very important to Ghanaians. In the 12-month period before the pandemic, 1 USD was equivalent 5.3 Ghana cedis. After a period of relative stability, the USD rose significantly against the cedi. As of July 2023, the average inter-bank rate was 1 USD to 11 Ghana cedis. Even though the cedi has been relatively stable, the exchange rate is still significantly higher than the levels seen pre-pandemic as shown in the chart below.\n\n\n\nInternational reserves\nInternational reserves are simply any kind of reserve funds that central banks can pass among each other. These reserves can be used to support international transactions among countries. As an import-driven economy, those reserves are very important to Ghana. International reserves can be presented in their absolute dollar values or the relative months of import they can over.\nIn the 12-month period before COVID-19, Ghana had gross international reserves that were equivalent to 4.3 months of import cover. Those reserves have depleted significantly and currently at 2.5 months of import cover.\n\nWe see that exchange rate (aka dollar rate) is still significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic and international reserves have significantly depleted. On the basis of those indicators, we cannot say the country has turned the corner."
